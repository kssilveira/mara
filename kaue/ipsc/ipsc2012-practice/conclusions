solve easy the easy way
process input from hard to check the actual complexity (eg n * target for problem P)
write a checker whenever possible (eg problem P)
let the previous version running while you work on the current version (eg problem Q)

P
  10^11, pd to sum s, 100 seconds

Q
  backtracking, order words by size, match bigger ones first

R
  10^3 squares, 10^9 to find all the sums of 3 squares
